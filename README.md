## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A big problem I had while coding was while creating the unique link, I had to also reference the city since the API link required it to have the date and the city so without that I couldn't create the unique link or reference the API link also I had a big issues accessing the api key everytime I clicked on it as some of the information became null for no reason while other information stayed.
